<p>MakeUp Classes <br>
~I teach makeup classes for a starting price of $30 <br>
~If you want me to provide the makeup materials then an additional $10 is added to the total price. Therefore the total price will be $40 <br>
~If you would like to come with your own makeup materials, then the total price will be $30 <br>
~I will teach you any makeup look that you want to learn <br>
~I will provide a list of materials and go step by step through the whole process <br>
~At the end of the class, I will send you a recording of the makeup class so that you will be able to watch the &nbsp;
recording and practice at home <br> <br><br>

Time<br>
~Each makeup appointment takes between 1 hour and 15 minutes to 1 hour and 30 minutes depending on the look <br> <br><br>

Payment <br>
~I accept cash, cashapp, venmo, and Zelle
~Payment must be paid in full before leaving appointment <br><br><br>

I always welcome feedback and want you to inform me if you want to change anything BEFORE leaving the appointment. I want to make sure all of my customers are satisfied before they leave. Please make sure to follow these guidelines! I can't wait to work with you!
